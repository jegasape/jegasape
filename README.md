  "about": "I got my start programming in C and over time picked up skills in Qt/C++, C#, TypeScript,
            HTML, CSS, and Python. I’ve had the opportunity to work with multinational companies 
            where I primarily focused on building server-side applications using Go, C#, and Python. 
            Along the way, I gained experience creating scalable microservices, optimizing performance, 
            developing data pipelines, and building reliable backend and frontend systems 
            that keep things running today."
